 HLD and LLD based on the web scraping -
High-Level Design (HLD) for Web Scraping:

1. System Overview:
   The web scraping system is designed to extract data from websites automatically. It consists of the following components:
   - User Interface: Provides an interface for users to input the target website and specify the data to be extracted.
   - Web Scraping Engine: Responsible for performing the actual scraping by sending HTTP requests, parsing HTML, and extracting relevant data.
   - Data Storage: Stores the extracted data in a structured format, such as a database or file system.
   - Scheduler: Manages the scraping tasks and ensures efficient utilization of system resources.
   - Monitoring and Logging: Monitors the system's health, tracks scraping progress, and records any errors or exceptions.

2. Workflow:
   1. User provides the target website and defines the scraping parameters through the User Interface.
   2. The User Interface sends a request to the Web Scraping Engine to initiate the scraping process.
   3. The Web Scraping Engine fetches the HTML content of the target website using HTTP requests.
   4. The fetched HTML content is parsed using a parsing library (e.g., BeautifulSoup) to extract the desired data based on the defined scraping parameters.
   5. The extracted data is stored in the designated Data Storage system.
   6. The Scheduler manages the scraping tasks, including task scheduling, prioritization, and resource allocation.
   7. The Monitoring and Logging component tracks the scraping progress, records any errors or exceptions, and provides insights into system performance.

3. Security Considerations:
   - The web scraping system should adhere to ethical scraping practices, respecting website terms of service, robots.txt files, and rate limits to avoid causing disruptions or legal issues.
   - Implementing authentication mechanisms, if required, to access websites that require login credentials.
   - Implementing security measures, such as input validation and sanitization, to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
   - Handling potential anti-scraping measures employed by websites, such as CAPTCHA challenges or IP blocking, by implementing appropriate mitigation strategies.

4. Scalability and Performance:
   - The system should be designed to handle concurrent scraping tasks efficiently, ensuring optimal resource utilization and minimizing response time.
   - Employing distributed architecture or parallel processing techniques to scale the scraping process across multiple servers or threads.
   - Caching mechanisms to reduce redundant requests and minimize network overhead.
   - Load balancing techniques to distribute scraping tasks evenly across available resources.

Low-Level Design (LLD) for Web Scraping:

1. Web Scraping Engine:
   - HTTP Request Module: Responsible for sending HTTP requests to the target website and handling responses.
   - HTML Parsing Module: Utilizes a parsing library (e.g., BeautifulSoup) to extract relevant data from the fetched HTML content based on defined scraping parameters.
   - Data Extraction Module: Implements algorithms to extract specific data elements (e.g., text, images, links) based on defined scraping rules and patterns.
   - Error Handling Module: Handles exceptions, such as network errors, parsing errors, or anti-scraping measures, and provides appropriate error messages or retries.

2. Data Storage:
   - Database Integration: Provides integration with a database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store the extracted data in structured tables.
   - File System Integration: Enables storing the extracted data as files in specific formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) for easy retrieval and analysis.

3. Scheduler:
   - Task Management Module: Manages the scraping tasks, including task scheduling, priority assignment, and task queueing.
   - Resource Allocation Module: Allocates system resources, such as CPU and memory, to scraping tasks based on priority and availability.
   - Task Monitoring Module: Tracks the progress of each scraping task, records completed tasks, and provides status updates to the user interface.

4. User Interface:
   - Input Module: Collects user inputs, such as the target website URL and scraping parameters, and performs input validation.
   - User Authentication Module: Authenticates users and manages user accounts if necessary.
   - User Feedback Module: Provides feedback to users on the scraping progress, completion status, and any encountered errors or exceptions.

5. Monitoring and Logging:
   - System Monitoring Module: Monitors system health, including resource usage, network connectivity, and system performance metrics.
   - Logging Module: Records scraping activities, errors, exceptions, and user interactions for auditing, debugging, and analysis purposes.

Note: The above design is a basic representation and can be further expanded or modified based on specific requirements and constraints of the web scraping system.
